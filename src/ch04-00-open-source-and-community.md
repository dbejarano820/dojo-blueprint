# Open Source Contributions and Community

Open Source Software (OSS) is one of the most important pillars in technology, it enables collaboration and knowledge sharing between developers to ensure safe and trustworthy building blocks.

There's an important distinction to be made between Free Software and Open Source Software. The key difference between them lies in their philosophical foundations and their respective emphases. Free software is grounded in a philosophy of user freedom and ethical principles, promoting the idea that software should respect and empower its users. OSS, on the other hand, emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and practical benefits, without necessarily requiring a strong commitment to user freedoms.

It's important to note that these distinctions do not mean one is superior to the other; both have their places in the software ecosystem, and many projects bridge the gap between the two philosophies.

This is brought up because ethical principles and different philosophies are often expressed through software. For example, the Cypherpunk movement, which enabled the crypto and blockchain space we know today, a fight against the system. 

> "A cypherpunk is any individual advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change."

## The Dojo Way with OSS

As globally standout developers, we should give OSS the care it deserves. It's our responsibility to contribute and push towards technological advancements.

It's not true that the software industry is saturated, every talented developer around me can land a job as soon as they wish. What IS saturated is the amount of junior developers looking for an entry level job without any expertise or experiences that make them stand out. They don't take any extra steps and go down the traditional path, a degree and a few certifications but that does not make your profile stand out at all.

You know what does? OSS contributions, hackathon participations and personal projects experimenting with emerging tech. A GitHub profile that showcases this journey, when you go down this road you'll have job interview invitations in your email.

OSS could be seen as a shortcut, you can find yourself quickly interacting with talented developers from all over the world and learning during the process. It's a direct path to improving your skills as a developer, creating an attractive profile and discovering professional opportunities.
