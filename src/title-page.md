# The Dojo Blueprint

The Dojo Blueprint is a game plan that is constantly evolving and improving, shaped by ongoing community input from the Dojo Coding Private Network. Some sections may be incomplete or still under review and are marked under a 🚧 emoji.

It's a step-by-step game plan aimed to equip you with you with the most important frameworks and tools in order to become a global developer, and even a founder if you wish.  

Understanding that all the resources required for the transformation are free and online. A transformation not only into a high earning developer with great technical skils, but one that can master their own habits and properly network. That's why this blueprint works, it provides the clarity necessary to break out of your shell and keep leveling up.

The [Dojo Coding Private Network](https://skool.com/dojo-coding) is an exclusive Skool community for individuals that strive for freedom through technology. All things coding, blockchain, life engineering and decentralized finances.

For greater guidance regarding this blueprint, reach out to Daniel Bejarano for his 1:1 coaching service.

# Where to Start?

Depending on your goals and interests, you can choose different paths
through the Starknet Book. Here are some recommendations based on
various objectives:

- If you’re a **complete beginner** and want to start learning about
  Cairo and Starknet from scratch, follow the book in its entirety,
  starting with **Introduction to Starknet**.

- If you’re an **experienced developer** looking to quickly dive into
  writing scalable and decentralized smart contracts, focus on the
  Cairo Book, particularly **chapter 12: Starknet Smart Contracts**
  ([link](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch99-00-starknet-smart-contracts.html)).

- If you’re a **frontend developer** wanting to integrate Starknet
  with a React frontend using Javascript, prioritize the
  **starknet-js** and **starknet-react** subchapters in **Starknet
  Tooling**

- If you’re a **DevOps engineer** or **node operator** interested in
  running a Starknet node and indexer, head straight to **Starknet
  Architecture**.

- If you’re a **security researcher** or **smart contract auditor**
  wanting to learn about the Account Abstraction feature and its
  implications, go for **Account Abstraction**.

- If you’re a **blockchain enthusiast** curious about the underlying
  architecture and mechanics of Starknet and Cairo, explore **Starknet
  Architecture**.

- If you’re a **cryptography expert** or **researcher** eager to
  understand the fundamentals of STARKs and their connection to the
  Starknet ecosystem, delve into **STARKs**.

Feel free to mix and match these paths based on your unique interests
and requirements.
