# The Dojo Blueprint

The Dojo Blueprint is a game plan that is constantly evolving and improving, shaped by ongoing community input from the Dojo Coding Private Network. Some sections may be incomplete or still under review and are marked under a ðŸš§ emoji.

It's a step-by-step game plan aimed to equip you with you with the most important mental frameworks and tools in order to become a globally standout developer, or a founder if you wish.

Understanding that all the resources required for the transformation are free and online is important. A transformation not only into a high earning developer with great technical skills, but one that can master their own habits and properly network. That's why this blueprint works, it provides the clarity necessary to break out of your shell and get on track to constantly level up.

The [Dojo Coding Private Network](https://skool.com/dojo-coding) is an exclusive Skool community for individuals that strive for freedom through technology. All things coding, blockchain, life engineering and decentralized finances.

Here, members will have access to additional trainings regarding this blueprint, workshops, accountability and consulting sessions.
