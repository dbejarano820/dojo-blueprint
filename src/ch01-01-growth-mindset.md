## Understanding what's possible
It's no secret people dream of "making it". But what does making it mean? At what point do you know when you officially make it? Is there a $ amount? Is there a specific lifestyle?

I've had many conversations regarding this with highly successful people according to the metrics society cares about.

What I've discovered through my own experiences and speaking with mentors, **you never actually feel like you "make it"**.

The reason is because as you're going through the process of "making it", you evolve as a person and as a professional.

You level up. Your mindset expands. You see what's possible. You gain confidence. You realize you have more capabilities than you thought.

You start getting results and you realize how much untapped potential exists. So by the time you reach your goal (Goal Setting is crucial and will be discussed shortly), which was your definition of "making it", your standards are now at another level.

Your mind is now ahead and thinking about the next goal.

You leveled up significantly and the new level no longer feels like "making it". So you aim to level up again, this goes on and on. **THE PROCESS.**

There's always a club on top of the club.

This makes sense once you're in the middle of your ***Hero's Journey***, this is the most exciting aspect of the process... the experiences and effort of trying to accomplish your goals. The value isn't in the actual goal.

Most things of high value and that are worth pursuing in life, aren't easy to get.
