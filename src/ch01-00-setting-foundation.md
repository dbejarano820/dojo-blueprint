# Setting the Foundation: Mindset and Goals

Before even thinking of learning a high value skill, you should aim to become a fundamentally strong human always thinking about growing and improving. **Grow or die.**

The Dojo Blueprint is not just a technical journey, but also a personal development one. Having solid habits and mental frameworks gives you the right tools and confidence to take on any challenge. There will be bumps in the road, distractions and set backs; the key here is to always bounce back and stay consistent as much as possible.

Mindset, mindset, mindset. Wealth is a mindset.

You become mentally successful before it materializes in the physical realm. It's the law of attraction and how the universe works. Strategic visualization, constant manifestation and focusing on the day to day actions is key. You must focus on WHAT you can control, not what you have no control over.

The effort you put into coding. The people you surround yourself with. The time you put into financial education. Your discipline with exercise, diet and sleep.

This is the reason watching mainstream news is toxic, you can't control any of it. Consuming pointless entertainment on netflix and different social medias is an anchor to the rat race. Learning to balance it is key.

Become aware that what we feed our brains has a huge impact on how we operate and view the world.

Tread lightly, wake up and put the work in.
