# Setting the Foundation: Mindset and Goals

Before even thinking of learning a high value skill, you should aim to become a fundamentally strong human always thinking about growing and improving. **Grow or die.**

The Dojo Blueprint is not just a technical journey, but also a personal development one. Having solid habits and mental frameworks gives you the right tools and confidence to take on any challenge. There will be bumps in the road, distractions and set backs; the key here is to always bounce back and stay consistent as much as possible.

Mindset, mindset, mindset. Wealth is a mindset.

You become mentally successful before it materializes in the physical realm. It's the law of attraction and how the universe works. Strategic visualization, constant manifestation and focusing on the day to day actions is key. You must focus on WHAT you can control, not what you have no control over.

The effort you put into coding. The people you surround yourself with. The time you put into financial education. Your discipline with exercise, diet and sleep. 

This is the reason watching mainstream news is toxic, you can't control any of it. Consuming pointless entertainment on netflix and different social medias is an anchor to the rat race. Learning to balance it is key.  

Become aware that what we feed our brains has a huge impact on how we operate and view the world.

Tread lightly, wake up and put the work in. 


## Understanding what's possible
Commonly, there's a desire of many people to "make it". What does making it mean? At what point do you know when you officially make it? Is there a $ amount Is there a specific lifestyle?

I've had many conversations regarding this with highly successful people according to the metrics society cares about.

What I've discovered through my own experiences and speaking with mentors, **you never actually feel you "make it"**.

The reason is because as you're going through the process of "making it", you evolve as a person and as a professional.

You level up. Your mindset expands. You see what's possible. You gain confidence. You realize you have more capabilities than you though.

You start getting results and you realize how much untapped potential exists. So by the time you reach your goal (Goal Setting is crucial and will be discussed shortly), which was your definition of "making it", your standards are now at another level.

Your mind is now ahead and thinking about the next goal. **THE PROCESS.**

You leveled up significantly and the new level no longer feels like "making it". So you aim to level up again, this goes on and on. There's always a club on top of the club.

This makes sense once you're in the middle of you're Hero's Journey, this is the most exciting aspect of the process... the experiences and effort of trying to accomplish your goals. Not the actual goal.
